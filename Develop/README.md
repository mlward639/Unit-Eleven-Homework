## Installation
.............Use package.json to download dependencies (using npm install).

## Usage
On opening the Note Taker application, there is link to the notes page on the landing page. Clicking it brings you to note page with existing notes in the left-hand column (?? need local storage? or is this with the write file stuff) and empty fields in the right-hand column to enter new notes. Can enter title and text for each new note, then a Save icon appears (navigation at top page) and on clicking it, the new note is saved and shows up in left-hand column. If you click on this note in the left, it will then appear again in the right column. There is a Write icon in navigation at page top and on clicking this, you can enter a new note title and test in an empty field on the right column.

-------------------DELETE-------------------
## Getting Started


The application should have a `db.json` file on the back end that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

The following HTML routes should be created:

* `GET /notes` should return the `notes.html` file.

* `GET *` should return the `index.html` file.

The following API routes should be created:

* `GET /api/notes` should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

* `POST /api/notes` should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into `npm` packages that could do this for you).
## Bonus

You havenâ€™t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application has that functionality in the front end. As a bonus, see if you can add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline:

* `DELETE /api/notes/:id` should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.


back end is Express.js

must store notes with unique IDs in JSON file

deploy to Heroku
